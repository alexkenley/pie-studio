/**
 * Runs a multiplayer acceptance test unattended: starts PIE with the scenario's players, drives every player's
 * input and console through PIERemotePlayers, and decides each step from the logs.
 *
 * Scenario JSON:
 *   { name, map?, pie: { players, net_mode: "listen"|"dedicated", one_process }, join_timeout_s, settle_ms,
 *     steps: [ { name,
 *                do: [ { client, tape: {action, values} } | { client, press: {action, frames?} }
 *                    | { client, hold: {action, value, ms} } | { client, inject: {action, value} }
 *                    | { client, console: "cmd" } | { wait_ms } ],
 *                expect: [ { log: "host"|"client:N", pattern, min?, max? } ],
 *                forbid: [ { log, pattern } ],
 *                window_ms } ] }
 *
 * Evidence: the editor process's log (every line, captured while the run is active) and, for separate-process
 * clients, each client's own log file (<Project>_<N+1>.log) read from where it stood when the step began. In
 * one-process PIE every player logs to the editor, so `client:N` reads the host log.
 *
 * A step passes when every expectation matched its count and no forbidden pattern matched inside its window. It
 * ends early once every expectation is met, unless it forbids anything, in which case it watches the whole window.
